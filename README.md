This is a personal athlete data intelligence platform — a long-term side project designed to track, analyze, and visualize every aspect of my training, sleep, recovery, and lifestyle in one centralized system. It’s a fusion of sports science, data engineering, and self-optimization.

The goal is to create a complete, flexible, and extensible performance database that enables:

In-depth personal analytics and trends

Training optimization and injury prevention

Lifestyle correlations (e.g., how sleep affects intervals, or how weather impacts RPE)

Clean exportable insights for self-coaching, content creation, or scientific exploration

This isn’t just about storing data — the real power comes from analysis and visibility. This system enables:

Performance dashboards: showing progressions in VO2max, cadence, HRV trends, sleep quality over time

Weekly reports: with training load summaries, energy trends, and recovery status

Experimental correlations: e.g., linking poor sleep to slower paces or bad weather to perceived difficulty

Injury forecasting & training mistakes: tracking how overreaching, poor sleep, or missing meals impact performance

Content creation: generating shareable visuals, videos, or insights from real athlete data

This system will be the foundation for an end-to-end self-tracking engine, letting me build not just performance, but awareness, resilience, and informed decision-making. Eventually, I might open-source part of the stack, or evolve it into a framework others can use to become their own performance analysts.
